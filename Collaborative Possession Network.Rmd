```
Looking to create code for the simulation of a single possesion that roughly follows the Bayesian Network created in the first attempt file. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

start_possession <- runif(1)
print(start_possession)
if (start_possession <= 0.33){print('shoot')} else {if (start_possession <= 0.66){print('dribble')} else{print('pass')}}
```
