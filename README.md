## Objectives

## Background

## Methods

### Data

### Analysis

### Code

## TODO

* Install git and powershell 7
* Setup, practice Github
* Add parameters to functions 
    * Red Devils shooting % may be different than bad guys
    * Allows reuse of functions for both teams
* Update possession network visual

## Log

* 2025 04 18 created readme


## Questions

* Can a possession start with a turnover?
* Can a shot end as a turnover?
* Can a possession continue on the ball going out of bounds (not a turnover, pass, dribble, or shot)


## Learnings

* Start with team alignment - make sure you know objectives, background, scope, deliverables, timing, value, etc...
* Modify your .gitignore file to ignore files you don't want to push to Github
* Pull and push small chunks of code - focused on one thing at a time
* If it works, it's good!  Once it works, focus on simplifying, speed, asthetics
* If you are copying and pasting code, you likely want to create a function
* Rule of thumb - functions should be < 100 lines of code 
* Start simple, build complexity (modular)
* tibbles = friends
* Small chunks of code = friends
* Use .var as parameters in functions (helps avoid environment collisions)
* Nested if then statements can get complicated
